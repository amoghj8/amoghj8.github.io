## You know what's up:

<p>
It has been an interesting and web-tech driven summer. This summer, I finished working on Front-End and Back-End Web Development. This post is being written using Python's Django framework.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the front-end, initially, I worked on CSS and Javascript. I had prior knowledge of HTML. One of the highlights of front-end technologies was Twitter's Bootstrap. With the help of it, I was able to develop a fully responsive personal website. Javascript does indeed bring the much-needed functionality to the website. I was also introduced to a software paradigm called MVC or MVVM otherwise. It was good to know the separation of concerns within a website. I accomplished this using KnockoutJS. The dynamicity is what amazed me. Though React and Angular are the buzzwords in JS frameworks, since I had to hustle, Knockout was the viable option.
</p>

<p>
The rest of my summer holidays was spent on Django. The tutorials on the official website did help me in understanding the way it works. Similar to MVC, Django calls in ORM (Object Relational Mapping). The blog was my back-end project.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the summer vacation comes to an end, so does this post. This blog though will be updated regularly about the technologies I come across with each passing day.
